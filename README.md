# DSKit, the aftermarket blind spot detection, lane departure warning and drowsiness detection solution

Features such as driver drowsiness detection, lane departure warnings, and blindspot warning systems do not exist in all vehicles, especially in older or cheaper models. It is extremely unfortunate that many people do not have access to these valuable features that have been proven to dramatically increase driver safety.

By creating an after-market Driver Safety Kit that is easy to install and significantly cheaper than buying a new car with such features, we prove that such safety products should be as commonplace as a helmet when biking.
